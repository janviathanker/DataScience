# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting daily rainfall in Austin, Texas using historical weather data.  
The objective is to analyze how different weather parameters affect precipitation and to build a machine learning model for rainfall prediction.

## Dataset
- **File:** austin_weather.csv  
- **Source:** Provided in LMS (Austin Weather Dataset)  
- **Target Variable:** PrecipitationSumInches  

The dataset contains weather attributes such as:
- Average Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Dew Point  
- Visibility  
- Wind Speed  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Methodology
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Clean the data by handling missing values and special symbols ("T", "-")  
3. Convert all values to numeric format  
4. Select relevant features  
5. Split data into training and testing sets  
6. Train a Linear Regression model  
7. Evaluate the model using MAE, RMSE, and R²  
8. Visualize rainfall trends and correlations  

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**  

These metrics are used to assess the prediction accuracy of the model.

## Key Findings
- Humidity and dew point show the strongest correlation with rainfall.  
- Linear Regression provides a simple yet effective baseline model for rainfall prediction.  
- Weather data can be successfully used to estimate precipitation levels.

## How to Run the Project
1. Place the notebook and dataset in the same folder  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells sequentially  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It highlights how real-world weather data can be used for predictive analytics using simple regression techniques.
